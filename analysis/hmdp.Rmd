Here we examine data on bone-mineral density (BMD) from measurements
taken in a "reference" mouse population, the Hybrid Mouse Diversity
Panel.

```{r knitr, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#",results = "hold",collapse = TRUE,
                      fig.align = "center")
```

Load packages
-------------

Load packages and function used in the analysis below.

```{r load-pkgs, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
source("../code/plots.R")
```

Load data
---------

Read the BMD data from the HMDP study.

```{r read-data}
hmdp <- read.csv("../data/hmdp.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Plot distribution of BMD
------------------------

Plot the distribution of BMD in HMDP male mice (measured in their
femurs).

```{r plot-bmd, message=FALSE, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=3.5}
plot_bmd_histogram(hmdp,"femur")
```
